# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Automa** is a web application for managing Python applications and automation agents. This is an early-stage project designed to automate routine tasks through secure, extensible Python scripts and agents.

### Core Requirements (from zadanie.md)
- Automation of routine tasks: data processing, emailing, scraping, scheduling, monitoring
- Management of Python scripts and agents with full lifecycle control (start/stop, monitoring, logging, scheduling)
- Web application with local/LAN access and multi-user authentication
- API interface for integration and remote agent control
- Security features: authentication, script sandboxing, comprehensive auditing
- Extensible backend with module/plugin architecture and MCP interface support

### Planned Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (asynchronous, scalable, API-first, suitable for MCP interface)
- **Database**: SQLite (simple local deployment)
- **Task Scheduling**: Celery or APScheduler
- **Sandboxing**: Lightweight VM/chroot jail or WASM (NOT pure Python sandbox for security reasons)
- **Auditing**: Structured logging to files or database
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS dashboard

## Current State

Fully functional Python agent management platform with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication, Docker sandboxing
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Vuetify, complete UI for scripts/agents/jobs/monitoring
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive models (User, Script, Agent, Job, AuditLog)
- **Security**: JWT tokens, audit logging, Docker container isolation
- **API**: Full REST API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Docker**: Complete containerization with docker-compose setup

## Development Commands

### Backend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time setup)
uv sync

# Run backend server (development)
uv run uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload

# Run via main.py
uv run main.py

# Run via development script
uv run scripts/dev.py backend
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
# or via development script
uv run scripts/dev.py frontend

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# Build and run all services
docker-compose up -d

# Build sandbox image
docker-compose build sandbox-builder

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### Testing and Linting
```bash
# Backend tests
uv run pytest backend/tests/
# or via development script
uv run scripts/dev.py test

# Backend linting
uv run ruff check backend/
uv run scripts/dev.py lint

# Frontend linting
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

## Security Considerations

Based on project requirements:
- Never implement pure Python sandboxing - use VM/container/WASM solutions
- All agent actions must be audited and logged
- Email/password authentication with role-based access (admin/user)
- Consider 2FA implementation for production use

## Development Notes

- **Python Version**: 3.13 (updated from 3.14)
- **Package Manager**: uv (modern, fast Python package manager)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Security**: Docker sandboxing implemented, comprehensive audit trail
- **Extensibility**: Plugin-ready architecture with service layer pattern
- **API Documentation**: Available at `/docs` endpoint when running
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API and Vuetify Material Design

## Key Implementation Details

### Backend Structure
- `models/`: SQLAlchemy database models
- `schemas/`: Pydantic request/response models
- `api/`: FastAPI route handlers
- `services/`: Business logic layer
- `core/`: Authentication, dependencies, audit utilities

- `components/`: Reusable Vue components
- `stores/`: Pinia state management
- `router/`: Vue Router configuration

### Key Features Implemented
- User registration and JWT authentication
- Script upload and management with file storage
- Agent creation and lifecycle management
