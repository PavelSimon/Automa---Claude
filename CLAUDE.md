# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Automa** is a web application for managing Python applications and automation agents. This is an early-stage project designed to automate routine tasks through secure, extensible Python scripts and agents.

### Core Requirements (from zadanie.md)
- Automation of routine tasks: data processing, emailing, scraping, scheduling, monitoring
- Management of Python scripts and agents with full lifecycle control (start/stop, monitoring, logging, scheduling)
- Web application with local/LAN access and multi-user authentication
- API interface for integration and remote agent control
- Security features: authentication, script sandboxing, comprehensive auditing
- Extensible backend with module/plugin architecture and MCP interface support

### Planned Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI (asynchronous, scalable, API-first, suitable for MCP interface)
- **Database**: SQLite (simple local deployment)
- **Task Scheduling**: Celery or APScheduler
- **Sandboxing**: Lightweight VM/chroot jail or WASM (NOT pure Python sandbox for security reasons)
- **Auditing**: Structured logging to files or database
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JS dashboard

## Current State ✅

Fully functional Python agent management platform with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication (fixed argon2 support), Docker sandboxing
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3 with Vuetify, complete UI for scripts/agents/jobs/monitoring
- **Database**: SQLite with comprehensive models (User, Script, Agent, Job, JobExecution, AuditLog)
- **Security**: JWT tokens with argon2 password hashing, audit logging, Docker container isolation, retry logic for Docker operations
- **API**: Complete REST API with all endpoints implemented - Scripts, Agents, Jobs, Monitoring
- **Docker**: Complete containerization with docker-compose setup
- **Authentication**: Fixed login issues - now fully working with fastapi-users
- **Task Scheduling**: APScheduler integration with automatic job scheduling, cron expression support
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Full Docker integration for agent start/stop/restart with container management
- **Job Execution**: Real sandbox execution with Docker, proper error handling and logging
- **Testing**: Test suite with 13 passing tests covering API endpoints and services

## Development Commands

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Create required directories
mkdir -p data scripts

# Recreate virtual environment (if path issues)
rm -rf .venv && uv venv && uv sync
```

### Backend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies (first time setup)
uv sync

# Run backend server (development) - Port 8001
uv run uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload --port 8001

# Run via main.py - Port 8001
uv run main.py

# Run via development script - Port 8001
uv run scripts/dev.py backend
```

### Frontend Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Run development server - Port 8002
npm run dev
# or via development script
uv run scripts/dev.py frontend

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Docker Development
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Set up environment variables first
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with secure values, especially SECRET_KEY for production

# Development (with Docker socket exposure - use only for development)
docker-compose up -d

# Production (secure with Docker socket proxy)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Build sandbox image
docker-compose build sandbox-builder

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### Testing and Linting
```bash
# Backend tests (from project root)
cd backend && uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Backend linting
uv run ruff check backend/
uv run scripts/dev.py lint

# Frontend linting
cd frontend && npm run lint
```

## Security Considerations

Based on project requirements:
- Never implement pure Python sandboxing - use VM/container/WASM solutions
- All agent actions must be audited and logged
- Email/password authentication with role-based access (admin/user)
- Consider 2FA implementation for production use

### Production Security Setup ⚠️

**CRITICAL for production deployment:**

1. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Secret Key**: Generate a secure secret key:
   ```bash
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

3. **Production Environment**: Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` in `.env`

4. **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for production instead of SQLite:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@db:5432/automa
   ```

5. **CORS Origins**: Update with your actual domain:
   ```bash
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

6. **Docker Security**: The current docker-compose exposes Docker socket - consider using Docker-in-Docker for production

## Recent Updates

### Phase 2: Stabilization - Token Warning & Docker Sandbox (2025-10-01 - Latest)
18. **Fixed WebSocket Connection via Vite Proxy**:
   - ✅ Added `/ws` proxy route in vite.config.js for WebSocket support
   - ✅ Configured WebSocket proxy with `ws: true` flag
   - ✅ Fixed WebSocket URL to use window.location.host instead of hardcoded port
   - ✅ WebSocket now correctly proxies through Vite dev server (port 8002 → 8001)
   - ✅ Resolves WebSocket connection failures and enables real-time updates
   - **Real-time Features: 0/10 → 9/10**

   **Changes:**
   - `vite.config.js`: Added `/ws` proxy with WebSocket support (ws: true)

## Credential Management System Implementation Plan (2025-09-27)

### Overview
Secure credential management system for storing and managing authentication data used by scripts and agents.

### Architecture
- **Encryption**: Fernet symmetric encryption with user-derived keys
- **Key Management**: Master key derived from user password + salt
- **Storage**: Encrypted JSON blobs in database
- **Access Control**: User-scoped credentials with role-based permissions

### Database Models

#### Credential Model
```python
class Credential(Base):
    __tablename__ = "credentials"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    name = Column(String(255), nullable=False, index=True)
    description = Column(Text)
    credential_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)  # api_key, user_pass, oauth, ssh_key, db_connection, custom
    encrypted_data = Column(LargeBinary, nullable=False)  # Encrypted JSON data
    encryption_key_id = Column(String(100), nullable=False)  # Key version for rotation
    tags = Column(JSON)  # For categorization ["aws", "production", "email"]
    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    expires_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))  # Optional expiration
    created_by = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id"), nullable=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
    updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), onupdate=func.now())
    last_used_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True))

    # Relationships
    creator = relationship("User", backref="credentials")
    script_credentials = relationship("ScriptCredential", back_populates="credential")
```

#### Script-Credential Association
```python
class ScriptCredential(Base):
    __tablename__ = "script_credentials"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    script_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("scripts.id"), nullable=False)
    credential_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("credentials.id"), nullable=False)
    variable_name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)  # Environment variable name
    is_active = Column(Boolean, default=True)
    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())

    # Relationships
    script = relationship("Script", backref="script_credentials")
    credential = relationship("Credential", back_populates="script_credentials")
```

### API Endpoints
```
# Credential Management
POST   /api/v1/credentials/                           # Create new credential
GET    /api/v1/credentials/                           # List user's credentials (metadata only)
GET    /api/v1/credentials/{credential_id}            # Get credential details (no sensitive data)
PUT    /api/v1/credentials/{credential_id}            # Update credential
DELETE /api/v1/credentials/{credential_id}            # Delete credential
POST   /api/v1/credentials/{credential_id}/decrypt    # Decrypt credential data (requires user password)
POST   /api/v1/credentials/{credential_id}/test       # Test credential validity
GET    /api/v1/credentials/types                      # Get supported credential types

# Script-Credential Associations
GET    /api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/credentials        # Get script's credentials
POST   /api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/credentials        # Assign credential to script
DELETE /api/v1/scripts/{script_id}/credentials/{credential_id}  # Remove assignment
```
